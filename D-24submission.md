# :japanese_goblin: Question-Find Difference

> Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.  
> String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.  
> Find the letter that was added in t.  
> Example:  
> Input:  
> s = "abcd"  
> t = "abcde"  
> Output:  
> e  
> Explanation:  
> 'e' is the letter that was added.
